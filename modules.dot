/* Here's the tentative shape, based on the Python2.7 version of
 * PDART. It may not be right.
 *
 * I broke up the modules within fs to see what's used by whom.
 * Unfortunately, that package is a bit of a mess.
 *
 * Note that there is a SubdirVersions in both fs and multiversioned.
 *
 * Mark nodes blue when done.
 * 
 * Use this as a guide of what to convert next.

"""
The PDART project contains code to retrieve Hubble Space Telescope
data from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes and generate PDS4
labels for it.

**New to PDART?** Downloading happens in the :mod:`pdart.hst` package.
Label creation happens in the :mod:`pdart.pds4label` package.  Our
SQLite database tables are defined in the :mod:`pdart.db` package.
You can learn about *rules* and how to write them in the
:mod:`pdart.rules` package.

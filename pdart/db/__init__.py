"""
The pdart.db package contains code to build SQLite databases for PDART
archives.

This module is obsolete, replaced by pdart.new_db.

**New to PDART?** Look in :mod:`pdart.db.CreateDatabase` to see the
SQL used to construct the SQLite database tables.  If you need to
rebuild the database, use
:func:`pdart.db.CreateDatabase.create_database`.
